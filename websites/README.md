This final project is being created for 360 Electrical, Heating, Air Conditioning, and Plumbing, located in Ayden, North Carolina. This company is owned by Jeff McKeel (Megan's father). We have created this website with permission from him - all photos are his personal photos of his work. The only picture not sourced from Jeff was the service area picture, which came from https://gisgeography.com/north-carolina-county-map/. We cropped this picture and highlighted the portion of the map that accurately represented the company service area.
